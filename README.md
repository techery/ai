### [Understanding Agent Loops: How AI Assistants Use Tools to Solve Complex Problems](./articles/loop.md)

Discover the elegant architecture behind every modern AI coding assistant. This detailed guide explores:

- **The Simple Pattern**: How Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and other AI assistants all use the same fundamental approach
- **Agent Loop Architecture**: The Think â†’ Act â†’ Observe â†’ Repeat cycle that powers intelligent automation
- **Tool Integration**: How AI systems use file operations, shell commands, and external services to accomplish real work
- **Complete Implementation**: A working TypeScript example using Anthropic's SDK showing exactly how to build your own agent

**Key Takeaways:**
- No magic involvedâ€”just clever engineering around giving AI the ability to use tools
- Complete code examples demonstrating the core patterns
- Understanding that empowers you to use existing tools more effectively and build your own

### [Inside Claude Code: The Tools and Architecture That Power Your AI Coding Assistant](./articles/claude-code-tools.md)

A deep dive into Claude Code's specific implementation, revealing the engineering decisions that shape its behavior:

- **The Agent Loop**: How Claude Code's implementation differs from other AI assistants through explicit task planning and nested agent architecture
- **The Toolkit**: Detailed exploration of all 15 tools, from file operations to web search
- **Architectural Patterns**: Understanding TodoWrite/TodoRead for task planning and the Task agent system for complex operations
- **Practical Usage**: How to work more effectively with Claude Code based on its architecture

**Key Takeaways:**
- Two key features that make Claude Code unique: mandatory task planning with TodoWrite and the nested Task agent architecture
- Claude Code's 15 specialized tools and when to use each one
- Why certain operations are restricted or require specific approaches
- How to leverage Claude Code's architectural patterns for maximum productivity
