### [Understanding Agent Loops: How AI Assistants Use Tools to Solve Complex Problems](./articles/loop.md)

Discover the elegant architecture behind every modern AI coding assistant. This detailed guide explores:

- **The Simple Pattern**: How Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and other AI assistants all use the same fundamental approach
- **Agent Loop Architecture**: The Think → Act → Observe → Repeat cycle that powers intelligent automation
- **Tool Integration**: How AI systems use file operations, shell commands, and external services to accomplish real work
- **Complete Implementation**: A working TypeScript example using Anthropic's SDK showing exactly how to build your own agent

**Key Takeaways:**

- No magic involved—just clever engineering around giving AI the ability to use tools
- Complete code examples demonstrating the core patterns
- Understanding that empowers you to use existing tools more effectively and build your own
